Timeline:

Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Setup project, including getting webpack up and running. 
        Get canvas to show up on the screen, and spend time getting comfortable with the Canvas API.
        Integrate the ImpactJS Game Engine with the rest of my other functionality so I have a solid 
        base to work with.
        
Monday: Create underlying logic for the game - creating game objects, moving, and collision logic

Tuesday: Implement character and backgrounds into the game, colision areas, and double check logic now with better visual aids.

Wednesday: Implement level generation and/or looping to make the game an "endless runner", if there is time work on stretch goals

Thursday: Deploy

Bonus Features:

1) Enemies for the user to fight on the way to the exit, defeating enemies will increase your score
2) Add a boulder or a large enemy that is chasing the user
